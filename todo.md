# To Do:

refactor and read through code

update git name jesus why is it my real name - squish commits

change to use mongodb for local caching and the archive API for everything else

host pkl files somehow on the cloud? or elsewhere? S3? no idea

use the data dump to generate keyword stats and large thread stats to search - then for the explorers give the option to add multiple usernames to the search - do the API searches and build up the thread graph there and then

investigate bug with nan values on sentiment graphs?

ability to add more than one user for sentiment analysis and plot their sentiments on the same graph

interactions between 2 accounts

* all threads they both interacted with
* posts that they have liked from each other
* posts from others they have both liked

provide iframe for each web module

user statistics (this needs more people to join)

* most/least interacted mutuals (likes, retweets, replies)
* most/least interacted non-mutuals
